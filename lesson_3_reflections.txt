When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

collaborating with others..

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repositorty?

Local vesion might be undergoing chanes and you don't want them to be overridden by updates from GitHub automatically. 

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: fork - to clone a repository existing in GitHub directory on the server.

clone - make a local copy of a remote repository

branch - within a repository, make a different commit path for changes.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A: you can work offline and as you are making changes to the code, you can do conflict merge if needed.
